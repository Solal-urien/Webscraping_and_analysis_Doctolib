# Analysis of medical desertification

## Research question
The last few years have highlighted an acute shortage of doctors throughout France,
especially in certain (often rural) areas that can truly be described as "medical deserts". The
problem affects both general and specialist medicine (ophthalmologists...).
This project is an opportunity to collect online data to reveal the presence of these medical
deserts on multiple socio-economic levels , and observe socio-economical tendencies
such as heliotropism or coastalization.

# Methodology
To answer the question, we first collected data from the Doctolib medical platform, and
subsequently analysed the data. During this second part, we used some INSEE datasets in
order to obtain relevant socio-economic information. We then brought together the
information to analyse the link between the aforementioned data and the distribution of
doctors throughout France, by computing a linear regression model between the number of
doctors per inhabitant and the socio-economic covariates.
